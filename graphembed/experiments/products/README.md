Scripting work done in the week preceeding the ICRL2020 deadline, when Andreas
Bloch and I were trying to embed graphs in products of model spaces with the
curvatures of each factor learned automatically (including sign change).

This was when the idea of looking at the sum of the angles in geodesic
triangles occurred to us.

We did not manage to get better results than the hyperbolic space with the same
dimension.
